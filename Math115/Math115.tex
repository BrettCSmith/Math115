In Math 115, we take complex problems and break them up into simpler ones. For instance, we approximate the area of a region by subdividing it into rectangles. By breaking up a problem into smaller and smaller parts, we get better and better approximations of the true solution. In fact, sometimes we can compute the LIMIT of these approximations, giving us the best possible answer. Otherwise, we can understand the ERROR involved in our approximation.

Over the semester, we will develop techniques for solving problems in geometry, economics, biology and physics. These techniques include Riemann sums, integration, differential equations, Taylor series, and parametric and polar equations. We will also appreciate the beautiful way these ideas fit together within the theory of calculus, the mathematics of change.
